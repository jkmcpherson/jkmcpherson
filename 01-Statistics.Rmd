# Statistics

## Introductory R

The official CRAN '\*Intro2R'\* <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html>,

Wickham and Grolemund's \*'R4DS'\* <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>,

Douglas et al.'s '\*Intro2R'\* <https://intro2r.com/>

## Advanced R

Wickham's \*'Advanced R'\* <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/>,

Wickham & Bryan's \*'R Packages'\* <https://r-pkgs.org/>,

Jeroen Janssens's \*'DS at the CL'\* <https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/1e/>,

Other readings can include the RMarkdown and Bookdown readings:

Xie, Dervieux & Riederer's \*'R Markdown Cookbook'\* <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/> and Xie, Allaire & Grolemund's R Markdown: '\*The Definitive Guide'\* <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/>,

Xie's \*'bookdown'\* <https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/> & \*'blogdown'\* <https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/>

Lovelace, Nowosad & Muenchow's \*'Geocomputation in R'\* <https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/>,

Fay et al.'s \*'Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps'\* <https://engineering-shiny.org/>

## Introductory Statistical Programming

I've found W. Chang's \*'Cookbook for R'\* <http://www.cookbook-r.com/>, UCLA's Intro to R <https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/stat/data/intro_r/intro_r_interactive_flat.html> & BU's Basic Statistical Analysis <https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/R/R-Manual/R-Manual_print.html> the best single-page introduction for teaching R for statistics

Once you learn R and want a blend of R and statistical theory, A. Swoeney's <https://antoinesoetewey.com/> excellent ['Stats and R' Blogdown](%5Bhttps://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/statsandr)<https://github.com/AntoineSoetewey/statsandr> provides a PDF in 'What statistical test should I do?' <https://statsandr.com/blog/files/overview-statistical-tests-statsandr.pdf> that users click the end-node links to follow.

More theory can be found at \*Statistics for Biologists\* <https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm> and its sub-page \*Points of Significance\* <https://www.nature.com/collections/qghhqm/pointsofsignificance>

\*Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R\* HSAUR 3rd ed. <https://rdrr.io/cran/HSAUR3/> entirely available online as individual chapter PDFs, with the associated HSAUR3 <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HSAUR3/index.html> package in CRAN with Vignettes and official documentation reference manual <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HSAUR3/HSAUR3.pdf>

## Intermediate Statistical Programming

Regression: I've struggled to find reputable open-sourced pages of regression education, let alone incorporation in R, but the PSU STAT 501 <https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/> has caught my attention

Ecology statistics with Oksanen's \*vegan\* GitHub <https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan>, rdocumentation <https://rdocumentation.org/packages/vegan> and CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html>

## Advanced Statistical Programming

High dimensional statistics can be learned from Borg & Groenen's '\*Modern Multidmensional Scaling'\* <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28981-X>

## Data Visualization

Data visualization should use ggplot2 from the Tidyverse <https://www.tidyverse.org/>,

Wickham's '\*ggplot2'\* <https://ggplot2-book.org/>,

Wilke's \*'Fundamentals of Data Visualization'\* <https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/>,

W. Chang's \*'R Graphics Cookbook'\* 2e <https://r-graphics.org/>, and

\*\*DEFINNITELY\*\* give the ggplot2 extensions gallery <https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/> a peek, that I most highly recommend Patil's \*ggstatplot\* <https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot/>
