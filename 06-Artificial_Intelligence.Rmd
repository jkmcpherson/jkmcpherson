[DeepMind]([https://github.com/deepmind)](https://github.com/deepmind)) is an excellent gold-standard for the capability of deep-learning in the biological sciences, [AlphaFold]([https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold)](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold)) and the other [amazing discoveries]([https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research)](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research)) at DeepMind. The [AlphaFold Colab]([https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/notebooks/AlphaFold.ipynb)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/notebooks/AlphaFold.ipynb)) is also freely available as a simplified implementation.

[RoseTTAfold]([https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RoseTTAFold)](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RoseTTAFold)) by [Baek et al., 2021]([https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8754)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8754)) and [OmegaFold]([https://twitter.com/peng_illinois/status/1538536909814874113)](https://twitter.com/peng_illinois/status/1538536909814874113))

I think [AWS SageMaker]([https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-training.html)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works-training.html)) is best for its freedom of scalability; requires knowledge of [AWS Data Science]([https://github.com/data-science-on-aws/data-science-on-aws),](https://github.com/data-science-on-aws/data-science-on-aws),) and a review of the [Sagemaker Workshop]([https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-workshop)](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-workshop)) and [Examples]([https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples)](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples))

The Microsoft [DoWhy]([https://github.com/py-why/dowhy)](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy)) library for [causal inference]([https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/dowhy-a-library-for-causal-inference/)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/dowhy-a-library-for-causal-inference/)) recently popped on my radar
